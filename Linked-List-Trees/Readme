For this assignment, I was instructed to first make a double Linked List which killed off repeated values in Lab.
Then I was to input the original values (non repeat deleted) into a ordered binary tree, then input that ordering
back into the original List.

For the Double Linked List, I simply divided the work between the ints and the Fractions with a if statement to make 
my life easier. In the case that it is an int, I still input it into a list, but only use that to input it into the output
file. For the actually functions, I made two versions, one that handles integers and the other that handles Fractions.

For the Functions, I used a similar insert function as Integers, however I modified it so it works with lists.
Both insert functions are capable with dealing with repeat values being entered in by using the Random expression 
given in the assignment. 

For outputting the values, I used a postorder and inorder for both integers and Fractions.

For sorting the list of Fractions afterward, I simply cleared the original list, named originalformula then I push_backed
the values in a similar fashion of printing in order.

I did the same as above for integers.
